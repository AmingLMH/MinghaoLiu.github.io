I am a Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), holding a bachelor's degree from Yunnan University. My research focuses on program verification, where I employ formal methods to enhance the reliability and security of software systems. I aim to bridge theoretical advances with practical applications, contributing to high-assurance software development in critical domains.
